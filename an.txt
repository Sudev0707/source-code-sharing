CodeEditor.tsx Features Explanation

The CodeEditor.tsx file is a React component that implements a comprehensive code editor interface using the Monaco Editor (the same editor used in VS Code). Below is a detailed breakdown of its key features and functionalities:

1. **Core Editor Functionality**
   - Uses Monaco Editor for syntax highlighting, code completion, and advanced editing features
   - Supports multiple programming languages including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JSON, Markdown, SQL, Go, Rust, and C++
   - Dark theme (vs-dark) for better readability
   - Customizable editor options like font size (14px), font family (JetBrains Mono), minimap, smooth scrolling, and word wrapping

2. **Language Selection**
   - Dropdown menu for selecting programming languages
   - Displays language name and file extension
   - Updates syntax highlighting dynamically based on selected language
   - Separate mobile and desktop implementations for responsive design

3. **File Management**
   - Editable filename input field
   - Automatic file extension display based on selected language
   - Download functionality that saves code as a file with appropriate extension

4. **Code Sharing and Collaboration**
   - Share feature that encodes code into URL parameters for easy sharing
   - URL parameter loading on component mount to restore shared code
   - Public/Private visibility toggle (UI only, no backend implementation shown)

5. **User Interface Features**
   - Responsive design with different layouts for desktop and mobile
   - Toolbar with action buttons: Copy, Download, Share, Save
   - Mobile-optimized dropdown menus for language selection and actions
   - Glass morphism design elements with animations

6. **Code Operations**
   - Copy to clipboard functionality with visual feedback
   - Download code as text file
   - Save button (currently shows toast notification, no actual save implementation)
   - Share link generation and clipboard copying

7. **State Management**
   - React hooks for managing code content, language, filename, and UI states
   - Toast notifications for user feedback on actions
   - Mobile menu state management for responsive interactions

8. **Default Content**
   - Pre-loaded with a sample TypeScript code demonstrating Fibonacci sequence calculation
   - Welcome message and example code to guide users

9. **Accessibility and UX**
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Visual feedback for actions (copy success, etc.)
   - Loading states and error handling for URL parameter decoding
   - Consistent iconography using Lucide React icons

10. **Technical Implementation**
    - Built with React and TypeScript
    - Uses custom UI components from a design system
    - Integrates with toast notification system
    - Handles URL encoding/decoding for code sharing
    - Responsive CSS with Tailwind classes

The component serves as a full-featured online code editor that could be part of a code sharing platform, allowing users to write, edit, and share code snippets across different programming languages with a modern, responsive interface.
